        dc:description  "Proteins perform essential cellular functions, which range from cell division and metabolism to DNA replication. Thus, decoding the mechanism of action of cells, requires understanding of the functioning and physicochemical properties of proteins [1]. While the genetic code encodes the primary structure of proteins, they undergo various modifications as part of their normal functioning including addition of modifying groups, such as acetyl, phosphoryl, glycosyl, and methyl, to one or more amino acids after translation, which is known as post-translational modification (PTM) [2, 3]. PTMs play an essential role in regulating protein functions by altering their physicochemical properties and understanding these reactions provides valuable insights regarding cell function. Advances in proteomics research have significantly deepened our understanding of PTMs and their impact on cellular functions and disease mechanisms. The study of PTMs is now at the forefront of research in molecular biology and biochemistry. Many databases, software, and tools have been developed to enhance our understanding of the various PTMs that affect human plasma proteins and help to simplify the analysis of complex PTM data [4]. These PTM databases and tools contain significant information and are a valuable resource for the research community. Key databases include dbPTM, UniProt, and PubChem. Utilising these databases, protein-related information like substrate peptides, amino acid sequence numbers, and experimentally validated PTM sites can be identified and curated. This dataset presents curated information regarding PTM-related changes in the physicochemical properties of the 16 most abundant plasma proteins [5], i.e., Serum Albumin, Serotransferrin, Antithrombin-III, Apolipoprotein A-I, Apolipoprotein A-IV, Apolipoprotein B-100, Apolipoprotein C-II, Apolipoprotein C-III, Apolipoprotein E, Clusterin, Complement C3, Haptoglobin, Histidine-rich glycoprotein, Mannose-binding protein C, Hemoglobin, and Fibrinogen alpha chain. The physicochemical properties studied, and the impact of different PTMs on the properties, include the protein molecular weight, isoelectric point, surface hydrophobicity, and solubility. The PTMs explored include phosphorylation, acetylation, glycosylation, methylation, ubiquitination, SUMOylation, lipidation, glutathionylation, nitrosylation, sulfoxidation, succinylation, neddylation, malonylation, hydroxylation, oxidation, and palmitoylation.

        dc:description  "The model identified, among the factors determining the cytotoxic properties of metal oxide nanoparticles against HaCaT cell lines, a number of variables related to the processes occurring on the surface of nanoparticles in a biological medium, including the ability to form protein corona. The selected descriptors describe both the electronic structure of the metal oxides that are the components of the nanoparticles, i.e. the ionization potential (IP_ActivM_SM_#1, IP_ActivM_SM_#2) and the initial nanoforms, i.e. the particle size (Primary size) and the percentage content of the metal oxide which is the main component of the nanoparticle (Purity_#1) ; characterize nanoparticles in the medium, i.e. the isoelectric point (PZZP_#2), stability (Stability), potential for dissolution (Dissolution), generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS production) and protein adsorption (Protein adsorption). The listed descriptors reflect the features that are discussed in the literature as potentially related to the toxic effect of nanoparticles."@en;

        dc:description  "In this model the property of a nanomaterial is predicted not on the basis of descriptors characterizing the chemical composition of nanoparticles or physical properties of the initial nanoforms, but on the basis of descriptors describing the dispersion medium (pH, IP, D3_HeteroNonMetals) and the property of nanoparticles dependent on it (Potential ζ). The observed small size of the hydrodynamic diameter of TiO2 in solvents of strong acids and bases compared to other solvents may indicate stronger repulsive interactions between nanoparticles than in the case of other systems. Moreover, in the case of salt solutions, the observed large size of the hydrodynamic diameter of TiO2 may be the result of a thicker electrical layer surrounding the particles in the dispersion system."@en;

        dc:description  "Results obtained from developed model indicated that the cytotoxicity of hybrid TiO2-based nanomaterials is related to additive electronegativity (χmix) of studied nanomaterials that are indirectly related to the electron generation and ROS formation. ROS production is the most common toxicity cause as discussed in the literature in the case of nanoparticles. The high efficiency of surface modified TiO2-based semiconductors can be attributed to the involvement of TiO2 band gap (Eg) excitation and absence of noble metals at the TiO2 surface. It can be expected that noble metals (i.e. Pd/Pt) may trap holes (h+), at the same time photo-generated electrons can be then transferred from the valence band to the conduction band of TiO2 and to its surface where redox processes were initiated. Thus, observed reduction of the electron–hole pair recombination influences the reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and the photocatalytic redox process initiation. Since the electronegativity was positively correlated with the cytotoxicity it can be expected that some ions are released from the TiO2 surface easier than others."@en;

        dc:description  "This dataset contains tabulated potentials of mean force (PMFs) and associated adsorption (binding) free energies for interactions of amino acids side chain analogues and lipid fragments (LF) with a range of materials: titanium dioxide, iron oxide, amorphous silica, quartz, and a range of carbon-based materials including amorphous carbon, graphene and carbon nanotubes both in a pristine form and functionalized by certain chemical groups. All data were computed from atomistic molecular dynamics simulations as a part of the SmartNanoTox project 2016-2020. Version 2 of the dataset includes additional materials: zink oxide, zink sulfate in pristine and PMMA-coated forms computed within NanoSolveIt project (2019-2023). The data are intended to be used in coarse-grained models describing interactions of nanomaterials with nanoparticles, for the prediction of the binding affinity of proteins and lipids to nanoparticles, and as biological \"fingerprints\" of nanomaterials characterizing behavior of the nanomaterials in biological environments."@en;
